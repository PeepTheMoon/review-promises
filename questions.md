getManyCharacters in rickAndMortyApi.js is no longer working after implementing jest.mock, returns undefined response body values.
*use if statements in jest testing< if(url) === https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/1 witht hat return and if(url) === https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/ to return an array>--OR--use a data file and import the mock data, taking off the id from the url*

getQuote in api-promises.js only works with the first one.  I thought I set it up to return any number, need help to see what I'm missing

need help getting rick and morty character origins in api-promises.js
